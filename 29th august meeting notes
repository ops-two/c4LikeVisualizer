0:01 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Good morning. Are you in the house or in the office? Yeah, I'm at my place right now. Okay, that's all right.  Thank you for meeting me a bit early. I was working a bit late today because the morning my intent was not working.

0:15 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, I saw your offline like you were six hours, so I thought like you were sleeping and I should not wait because I don't know when you wake up and like it will get late, so I just came back home.  I don't know my internet for some reason like I got cut or something and I did not find internet in the morning.  I think still it's still it's cozy. I think it's my network. It's your network. The video is posted to your network with your network like it's showing on your end.

0:47 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  It's not showing at my end.

0:49 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  You can hear my voice, right? Yeah, I can.

0:51 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  can.

0:52 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, your your video is a bit. Okay.

0:56 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Let me just. Is this all right? me just. It be. be. Thank Yeah, yeah that's great.

1:02 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Let me quickly recharge my phone. I bought a new one.

1:04 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay. Which one did you get? Yeah.

1:09 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Oh, let me see if I can.

1:15 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Moto. Moto, yeah? Yeah. That was the first one.

1:21 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, I thought about iPhone as well, the refurbished one, but it was costly. It was going up to good.  In good condition, it was like 55, 50, 60. So, I skipped that.

1:31 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  The 14 Pro model. That's expensive. Yeah. Yeah.

1:36 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  So, yeah, let's start. Let me just recharge my phone.

1:42 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Connect it to my phone.

1:43 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think I got recharged. Yeah.

1:50 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay.

1:52 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  In the meanwhile, have you checked the calendar?

1:57 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  For Atelius? Yeah. Yeah, not yet, actually.

2:03 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, please open it because I don't have credentials locked in here.

2:08 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  You should have credentials, no?

2:13 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  It's in the main laptop, not in this one.

2:18 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  I haven't logged in. Okay. Let me see if I can log into it. So what change did you make?  Not here. So what did you change in that calendar? Your speaker, your microphone is not working. Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank Thank you. Thank Thank you. Okay, I think, yeah.

3:35 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay.

3:36 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah.

3:37 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Did you say it's good? Yeah.

3:41 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Sure. I have one more thing.

3:50 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Because of weather conditions, I'm not going on the trip. The weather is not good in me right now. Yeah.

3:57 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  That's terrible. Yeah.

3:59 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah. Yeah. True. As well, it's raining right now. The whole year was raining and it's raining as well. In Jammu Kusmeri, it's much worse.

4:09 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  I have only been there once. I've gone to Shimla. That's not even Kashmir. You were going to West Nadeem.  Yeah, that would not be very good. Right now, no.

4:22 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yesterday, a rogue fell from the top and some like 30 people died in that. So it was good. Yeah, there.  And the train got cancelled by the official, not like we cancelled the tickets.

4:36 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah.

4:37 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, this is what I have changed.

4:40 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  A bit of improvement on that.

4:42 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  If you change the slots. Yeah, this is better.

4:56 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. Then we're agar Yeah. Thank you.

5:17 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Let's see if it is redacting or not. haven't checked it. Yeah, this was I think solving yesterday. I haven't pushed it.  I have to take a look on that as well. So it moves a bit down when clicked on confirm button.  I think I haven't pushed this.

5:36 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So after this step, it wasn't supposed to go to the console. Yeah, I saw the stripe. What you want me to do?

5:54 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Console, console. Elements right here. Console next to it. What is the error we found? Could you please scroll up?  I'm not sure what was the error. We were not able to. I will take a look at that as well, because what I have changed is because it is in iframe, we can't inside like we can't go to Stripe payment directly inside it.  I tried, but we were not able to. So what I am doing is open the new tab for that link.  Okay. To pay the price. We are listening to the event listeners. So like someone paid so we can confirm that.  I'm not sure how to send the payment intent. So like the record ID of the invoice or is it paid or not?  I'm not sure how to do that in Stripe.

6:43 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  You could do one thing. And this might be a bit tricky. So you have your app. So you can have a JavaScript code that looks for a flag from that app.  And the code can live within software's native homepage. And it only looks for a listener saying Stripe true, you pass the payment ID to that listener, and the listener takes you to Stripe.  That's how soft is it? Because you know how fill out forms, you can pass data from software to fill out when you fill out.  So something similar.

7:24 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  So right now, the link will contain the record ID.

7:35 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  This doesn't load yet. Changement.

7:58 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think. G-- A- Thank Then I will take a look on the Schema Tracker. had to make a lot of changes in permission.  Policable payment is not around with this document. Okay, I think that's the issue we are facing. The following methods type are not activated.  This is the error. Yeah, I think this is the error. And I think it's being sent from the...

8:22 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  What you could do is, if on Stripe send, you, instead of this URL, if you link it to this URL, so it allows loading inside the iframe, inside this, an iframe within the URL to get it to work, within here itself.

8:41 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Do we have the, like, options to allow whitelist kind of in Stripe? You'll have to check.

8:49 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  You'll have to check that. This is the, the URL is from the...

8:56 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  But you can have a button, take me to Stripe, and then...
  ACTION ITEM: Implement button solution for Stripe integration if auto-redirect fails; add "Take me to Stripe" button that opens new tab
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/393898283?timestamp=537.9999

9:00 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  And that button could be a script that actually opens a new tab. I think I will take a look on that.

9:06 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Like if it's like automatically redirecting, then it's OK. If it's not, then no problem. We will implement the button solution.  Let me see my screen now. Also, we have to check the schedule, like how it's looking. Where is that?  OK, I'm going to go off store, yeah.

9:50 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  OK, so yeah, I was able to add the mini IO in the table.

9:56 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  So right now, all the data is being stored on mini So the API is working for now, let's see.  have to make some changes in it as well. Okay, I think 29, 9.30. It automatically ran for 1 minute 30 seconds.  And if we can zoom in a bit, some of them were new, so they went to this direction and new components were fetched.  From it, there was only component, okay. Oh, I think it's a one node only. Shared, what is this? Sync projects to bubble.  Okay, let's see the schema. I think it has some. Shared, trigger count zero, connection zero. Nodes, okay, so nodes are zero.  I think that's why it's not counting any components. right. so so took It's like let's Okay, because Thank And six of them, yeah, error handler.  So this one is, if we go to here, I think this might, this one, throw error. This one is related to API key.  So if we have any problem in the API key, we will go to that particular API key record, error in tool, and we will update the record with the last checked, skip history, error, and detailed error.  We will show the error only with the user. So it will be like something. It's running again. So for checking focus, I have scheduled it for two hours.  Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

11:47 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  If you run it at a higher frequency, most of the time there will be no updates. There will be no new tools.  Yeah. yeah.

11:55 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  This one is running as well, and previous one ran successfully. Six minutes, 33 seconds. Okay, good. Thank

12:07 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay, so over the weekend I'll be working on the interface a bit. So you are looking at the pieces in place.  I think the only thing missing is now the sequence diagrams. Yeah, I'm working on that right now, on the UI first, then I played as Inter2D.  The other part of the UI, and then over the weekend, probably on Monday, we should be able to test some parts.  Yes, yeah.

12:33 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  So as you can see, I have added some API keys with like wrong data, here, test, test, and it is being filled with 400, like error is here, detailed error is object object, okay, I have to stringify it, invalid URL, invalid URL, status code, 400, and this is API error, okay.  So, will be showing the top header, the API key of the connection.

12:58 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Then you have tools. Yes. Yes.

13:00 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  And tools have the error as well. Bad request, bad request. And the detailed error is here. Yeah. This is what our perspective like.  Okay. And after that, I think it's running down. And it ran successfully. Let's see if you have something here to check.  Plus icon. No new tools found. Everything was 55 items. How many items were there? 100 items. And out of them, 45, 40 errors.  If you go to the errors, I think what was the error of this one is client order portal. Error, bad request.  Okay. You were not able to get the scheme of this. think tool ID is this one. So client order portal, you may have deleted it or something else, I guess, not found.  So I think it got deleted.

13:58 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So what is this exactly? not a I'm where Like, is it an N10? Which one is it? Airtable Tracker.

14:05 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, this one is Airtable Tracker. 45 items are deleted. And I have to make a bit of change in the whole workflow, like this one.  If it is the first time, I was not checking that there is no previous schema and just like posting it.  But now I think it's fixed now. So it will first check the previous schema if it exists. Then only go to the checking with the current schema.  If it doesn't exist, we will suppose like this is the first time we are adding this tool. Because like if the user creates a new connection, we have no schema.  So for the first run, we need to create it.

14:40 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So no previous schema will be found.

14:42 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  And yeah, it's not working right now. Let's check the make one. Make one has no changes. So I don't think it will run for a longer period of time.  Yeah, 175 milliseconds. Okay. And why is there one tool? Because we were not able to find anything. In the last.  All thank you. Okay. All right, so... Also, think we are checking the skip history. Okay, so in the last run, 12 to 12 volts, no error found, success is 8 items.  Let me check. So if you see here, I think the link is MiniIO, right? So it's being automatically uploaded to MiniIO documentation.  The same instance we were using for the editor or custom editor. Okay, everyone bad request, bad request, what's the error?  Okay, I think we have checked it as error and the skip history will be true. Okay. You're uploading to Mini-IO.

16:01 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Are you setting a timeout? When that's ..

16:07 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  We are not doing anything in Mini-IO. It's being done by a driver. No.

16:12 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  OK. Yeah.

16:35 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  What should be the user experience of creating a workflow? How the user will create? If there is no workflow, how the user will create?  Where to create? And how to create the workflow?

16:49 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  There will always be an empty workflow. I was just thinking of putting a plus icon like you have for story.  Have a similar plus icon. Mm-hmm. Folder with the plug. And that should be it. And between two vertical lines, there should also be a plus icon like I've shown in the markup, so that should take care of it.

17:12 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Like this one, right?

17:17 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah, yeah. Like that. There is one more nuance, which is the larger blocks, which hold the sequences. There can be nesting inside.  See if it is possible, if it is too complicated, to put nesting inside. So nesting. Sorry?

18:03 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yes.

18:05 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Basically, you're grouping sequence. So one group of sequences inside another group of sequences. Why? Because sometimes you want error workflows or you want to have retries, which means it's not the linear sequence, but you are breaking the sequence into smaller chunks.  It's still part of the larger sequence, a group of sequences, but that smaller group in itself. So if you have a workflow where you need to branch or where you need to do an if-then, then you can't have this straight diagram, right?  So you can have a smaller group like the same, the green group that you have at the top and bottom.  You can have a smaller group that only holds a smaller number of sequences inside the bigger ones.

18:59 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  thank you very much. So basically, if you go through the normal diagram... Sorry, Rahul, please go ahead.

19:09 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  I wasn't able to hear you.

19:12 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, so it will be like... ...which can contain work inside it.

19:23 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  That voice is cracking too much. I am not able to hear you.

19:36 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay, I think it might be my internet issue. That's the...

19:59 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay, think it was you. Is internet issue or mine one? Because mine one is working. Yeah, I seem to have...

20:06 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Can you check on Fathom? I'm getting 60, 70, 80 MBPS.

20:15 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay, Fathom.com. Let's see. I'm on mobile, so I'm getting low, but my YouTube is working. 10 MB per second, 12 MB per second.

20:30 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay, I don't know why. Maybe Google network. Do you have a VPN or something?

20:38 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Hmm, no.

20:41 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay, I don't know why. I'm just clearer now.

20:45 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  20 MB per second.

20:48 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah, okay.

20:49 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think I am sharing my screen again. Let me see. If I can. I think it's loading right now.  Mm-hmm. Okay. I will take a look on that. So I think we will have workflows inside workflows. We can have a bigger workflows as well here.

21:08 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So basically, you can have, so instead of having workflows like Unlimited Nest, just allow one level down. That's it.  So only one level of sub workflows inside a workflow. So this is the one.

21:29 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  But if you have two workflows, if you have two workflows inside it, like this one, there might be one here, and one here, then we need.

21:39 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So in this smaller loop, no overlap. But in the bigger one, they can stay within. So they should stay within the bigger one first.  So they cannot go across two big workflows, workflow A and workflow B. So there can be no group. So you can.  can. also call it group in code. You don't need to call it a workflow. But a group cannot go across outside a workflow.  It has to be within a workflow. OK, so a group will need to have a label as well, I think.  This workflow is a group, right? That's a larger group, and there is a small group within it, right? One or two more.  Now, let's call them subgroups. So there can be a subgroup inside a subgroup. Subgroups can only be within the main group.  And there can be no sequence overlapping two subgroups at the same time. OK, got it. Yeah.

22:50 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  So first, we already have workflow. Then we will need one more data type, the subgroup, right? And while creating another subgroup, we have to check that.  have to check out.

23:06 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So basically a data type gets added to the sequence if it has, so the subgroup data type added to sequence and not add sequence to subgroup data type so the relationship should be between sequence and subgroup and not the sequence and not the other way around.  Okay? So in that way you can only choose one for a sequence. So that's by default you'll not have that issue.  So why I'm saying is group is important. If you look at the UML schema for sequence diagrams, it has those groups essentially.  If you look at cheat sheets somewhere, you'll find that this is a group that smaller. at the-Langler. much. .  . . Yeah. Yeah. That's the proof. Yeah. So it's something similar that I want from you. Got it. Okay.  So in the traditional UML schema, the vertical line, they represent how long the service is active for. So it has a role.  We have used circles to show that. But when they're using a vertical on the lifeline, so they use a vertical rectangular line, then that is usually to show how long the service is active for.  So service is only active when that thing is running. But in Make and other tools, it's always running. So we don't need to worry about that.  We are only using start and stop. stop. Thank

25:05 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  That's, this is it, I think, the nuance here.

25:09 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  How are you finding it? I think you have done some work on it. How are you finding it? Okay, so this one?

25:18 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, so right now, like, when I started, I started with the story mapper. So basically, I was trying to like, okay, first, I gave the context to the AI.  So this is the context, try to build something around it. So we divided that thing into requirements, then planning and technical requirements, and then step by step, we implemented that.  But the thing was, it was not that easy. So this is the first time, and like, it got a bit, like, a bit more complicated than I thought.  So if you go to story mapper, so the thing was the issue I faced, two, three issues that majorly cost me a lot of time.  And one, the sequential diagram you provided me was not based on react flow. Okay. You are importing the Reactflow library, but you are not using it.  So in this case, I didn't check that it is using or not, and I just continue with workflow. Then I checked, okay, is this even using Reactflow, but it was not.

26:15 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So in the current one, I'll use it.

26:18 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, it's not using it. The component is manual. So in the story mapper, so as you can see, this is features.  This is features. But if we see it closely, just call it features. We have something that, okay, feature custom feature three.  We don't know why we named it like this.

26:44 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  But it's still working, right? Other one are simple ones.

26:49 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  So there was a naming issue that I faced of this one. In the data type, I had sequence from container into container.  was not able to get the data from the content. That's from the database. was not returning it properly. OK.  Second thing was this. So I have to use something. I have updated this document. Part 5 incorrect field name.  we have learned something from this using wrong fields name when accessing bubble relationship data, null defined. So to get the number of how they are representing it inside the database, we have to use this one, object.key sequence.data.  So like this, instead of from container, have to like this from container, everything is small under custom content component sequence type as well.  So like this, you are, you will get the data called.

27:40 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So there is something.

27:42 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Then this was something that I was facing myself. It was my mistake that I was not meticulous about that.  The event triggering the name was not correct. So it was a lot of time as well. So two, three things were there that definitely cost me a lot of time.  After that, I think I just copied the scene. Same structure, same data type, same like from your sequential HTML to create the layout and the StoryMapper as a context.  So we were able to get the inline area as well from there, we were able to get the event as well from there.  So two, three events are being called. The issue we are facing right now is the re-rendering part. I tried to do it, but it's not as efficient as the StoryMapper.  I don't know why. I have to check on that.

28:28 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  It's a great issue.

28:29 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think we were able to learn a lot from this one as well. Great.

28:33 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  How are you calling the React files themselves?

28:38 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I'm not uploading. There is no React files. It's only plain JavaScript. Oh, so you're not using React at all?  I think we are using the React as a, we are using the row React. We are not using as a library.  So here it is a library, but we use as a VEET inside next year. So that is something else.

28:59 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  But what we are just importing.

29:00 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  So we have all the code declarations inside that library, right? We are just using the library from it. So it's a plain JavaScript.  Okay.

29:08 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Everything is a plain JavaScript. Yeah. Got it. Got it. Okay. All right. What else do we have on those updates?

29:22 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think I'm still working on that. Yesterday I was able to like just put it, this one, all of the triggers, corrected them.

29:30 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay.

29:31 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  One more thing I have is this one. API keys tester.

29:38 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So check for each case.

29:40 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  there is success, don't do anything. Go to the loop. If there is an error, everyone will go to this one.  API key not working and just pass the request with that error we are facing.

29:51 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Make sure you filter it for the error type, because if you are getting an error of like 4292 and when they request, you should not go to the error mode.  So. Make sure you are checking for the right error so that you don't filter for the wrong errors. You only should have limited errors like tool not found.  Not found is all right but too many requests is not a valid error in this situation.

30:27 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think I have two three times at least so it should not usually send the too many request error but let's filter it out for that as well.  So here filter as well for that. What are other errors we might face when calling the API for verification?

30:54 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So you will receive 400 series errors and 500 series errors so those are the Two mains. 500 series is your server errors.  So server is down or something. 400 series has just 401 page not found or 403 would be invalid request.  But the problem is not everybody implements the error codes religiously. So there would be some differences in how different tools implement those errors.  Airtable user is 429 for if you make more than six requests in a second, it will give you a 429 error.  It will be different. So you have to be a bit careful about that. And maybe just loop through the different items instead of running it sequentially.  So you already have loops, right? that should be fine.

32:03 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, yeah, I think that's all. Manhattan workflows and the UI update of calendar. That's all I did yesterday. Right now I am feeding the context to the Gemini.  I think I have exhausted the stuff. I think we have already exhausted 300 credits while building the visual workflow.  are using your flow in the starting of the month. Right now we have 148 credits.

32:38 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I don't know. Okay. Yeah.

32:43 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I'm trying Gemini right now because I think they have a tool. I think I'm not setting the whole screen.

32:53 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Let see my entire screen.

32:56 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Trying this one. If it doesn't work, then I will go back to the print server. Okay. So this one is a kind of gems.  can create it here.

33:07 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Gemini.

33:10 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  And here you want, you can create a new gem with a context, files, knowledge, instruction. So that's what I am trying to do right now.  It takes a lot of time to answer, but it does.

33:28 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Right now I'm working on the visualizer part because then we can add the interactivity to it. Yeah. Yeah. So, so yes.  And if, so what you can also do is if you want, build it in chunks using Gemini and maybe at the end run the opus, cloud opus to merge and get it to work.  Because cloud opus is the most powerful one there is at this point. It has the most context window. It remembers, even if it's writing for too long, it remembers better.  It has better understanding of the system.

34:15 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Right now, I think we have in the midst of Cloud for Net, and it works pretty good, better than the Gemini right now.  I think Gemini, just because Gemini doesn't have enough context and it's not working on the entire files, that's why it's not performing.

34:31 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  First draft is very good with Gemini right now. If you want a small code, it writes it better than anything else.  But if you want multiple codes and connected and without mistakes, I think Cloud will win in that. See ourself.

34:49 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Also, okay, so we checked the API key and we faced an error. Now we have checked this as, checked this one as, is API working to false?  Okay. Now, in the next one, will we still check that API or just because we have it once a day, it's all right.

35:12 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Just checking whether the API key is working that we can do daily. If a tool is deleted, but the API is working, then you can, after let's say 10 days of inactivity, you can pause calling for that tool.  You can skip that tool. And we will have to put a date filter, like we'll try for 30 days.  And if it's more than 30 days old, we are getting errors. We'll just stop.

35:48 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  For tools, if you are getting error, then we are already skipping it, I think. Yeah.

35:54 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  If you're getting an API error, then you skip it, skip all the tools underneath it. If for individual tool, you're getting errors.  An error, you'll not get the schema, but the question was, will you check again or not?

36:11 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  So right now, the current workflow is, it's checking for if you are able to get the schemas or not.  Even if you have 0, 1, 2, you can still get it, right?

36:18 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So the API key is different.

36:20 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  But for a tool tracker, we are individually getting the schema of that tool using the link. Suggestion for your workflows and the tool ID.  If you are not getting the tool, we are marking that tool as error.

36:33 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay. Okay. I think we need to have a way to recover those tools because right now, I don't think there is a way.  if a tool is marked as error, what is the way to uncheck that error and make it one? So let's say I deleted an Airtable base or I moved Airtable base outside my account and then I brought it back.  So how do I now get it to sync? Hmm.

37:00 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Hmm. I... I think we have the option to toggle it, right? So think this webbook will work at this time.

37:09 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  The webbook we will send, the user will click on the toggle on.

37:13 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  We will show that, okay, we are trying to do something about it and just a webbook will run. And if it error, then we will just reflect, okay, there is an error.

37:22 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Got it. Got it. Okay. Okay. Makes sense. You might also want to have a solid workflow run for situations where the API key is working, but some of the tools have errors.  We should retry that for seven or 10 days before pausing. So if the tool error has been resolved, then you should check again, right?  So we will implement later. No worries. I don't think it's not a common situation.

37:53 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  The user can manually do it. think it's an error.

37:59 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah. Manually.

38:05 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  And like we will just uncheck that so it will drag from the next iteration or maybe this one as well.

38:11 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay. Okay. Makes sense.

38:14 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  And what else I was... Okay. Yeah.

38:33 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay. Okay. Okay. All You Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, sorry for my network, I think it's not working.

41:33 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay, so the question was, okay, while adding the connection, had two 10 tools. But after adding the connection, I have added five more tools.

41:46 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay.

41:48 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Do we need to automatically add the tools or how do we handle that?

41:54 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yes, you'll have to pick up, yes, automatically. Hmm.

41:59 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah. Okay. Okay.

42:00 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay. Okay. Okay. I think you'll have to expand on that automation you built to check the API key itself.  Yeah.

42:14 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  We had it initially in the first, but not really sweet. I think we might need another workflow for picking up the tools.  I think it's better to show the refresh kind of button there. Like in Ener10, when we have made changes to server flow, we have the option to refresh and show the new fields.  We can, you know, but how we will receive that, there is some... ... ... new changes I think I will expand the api keys verification yeah maybe you'll probably need an api key verification workflow for each tool for all the tools you might have separate workflows for each tool yeah and for each uh api key successful iteration we will get all the bases all the schemas off to fit and we will check against it that if we have that already exist or not yeah yeah yeah got it okay or do we need to show an extra option like do you want to track new tools automatically or not uh so the thing is it's already there so if on the mock

44:01 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  If next to the connection itself is on, then anything that is new to that connection should automatically show up.

44:16 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  But we don't have any fielding to able to handle that.

44:22 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  If the API key is on and set to auto track all the tools, Yeah, any new tools will also be auto tracked.

44:37 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Ah, got it.

44:39 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  That makes sense.

44:41 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  And it will be easier for us to implement. Okay.

44:46 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  When you're creating a new connection, you have a top checkbox field in the pop-up.

44:53 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah. Okay, what else do we have?

44:59 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Exactly.

45:00 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  We have a Thank

45:08 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  I think we are getting close to the whole structure right now.

45:12 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Like you have made improvements to the UI and it's looking much better and I think it will be easier to navigate.  I think when I tried yesterday, the navigation was not working on the workspace page.

45:22 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah, so workspace page, it's a bit more complex in the project page because there are more tabs. Trying to figure out the best, reliably navigate every time you change it also.

45:35 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  So I think I'm going to the page so that like we will have a refresh kind of item in it and at the same time.

45:47 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  And yeah, I think yeah, it'll be better if I show you on Monday after I do some some work there because I implemented some methods in project and it's looking cleaner now.  I Macklin. Kareem, thank Thanks so for going on. Thank Thanks finally We were using the states. Yeah, so custom states are the way to go, it seems.  But in project, you also see the custom state and there is a URL parameter also. So there's a URL parameter and custom state.  So if you refresh the page after opening a particular parameter, it goes to that section, not the...

46:27 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think the workspace was implemented that way only. the URL was changing, workspace slash tools. And if the URL contains the tools, then so this section, it was something like that.  Not with the states, but with the URL.

46:41 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah. But I have to... you put it as arbitrary text.

46:48 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  The arbitrary text, if you send it, so it will be like slash slash kind of. So workspace slash tools.

46:54 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  The thing is, yeah, it confused me a bit. Why were you doing it? Because afterwards... The idea is to send the workspace ID.

47:06 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  It's like workspace slash tools, the ID is in the query parameter. No, I understand.

47:11 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  But if you do the workspace slash ID, and then your query parameters, then ID becomes part of the main URL and not a query, not a parameter.  And that's how you should have it so that you can copy a link. And even if you strip the URL parameters, you still have the link to the workspace.  If you see Airtable, Airtable does Airtable.com slash app name, slash table name. Obviously, they're using much different methods. But we cannot have multiple slashes in Bubble unless we are using a script.  And that makes it heavier to load. Yeah, okay. Have a workflow, workspace, and then have everything else load via customs.  And you are in parameters instead. Mm-hmm.

48:04 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Got it. Got it.

48:07 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay. So what else do we have? We have your performance tracking today. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

48:14 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yes, sir. Okay.

48:16 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Let's take a look at what we have this time. I don't think there's a lot of stuff. Yeah, I don't think it's as well.

48:26 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay.

48:27 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So there is one new item which we had just to get this.

48:59 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay. Thank you. Schema Tracker, then Visualization Tool, then Dashboard, two, things.

49:32 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So let's go one by one. AI changes summary generator? We are not generating a summary yet. Oh yeah, we are doing that.

49:40 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay. I am doing that as well. let me show that as well.

49:45 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay.

49:45 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  How I'm doing this. Where is that? So if you go to the. Extended component update, so I will get the JSON changes, open it, executed by another row, I turn the JSON changes, or empty, so summarize the JSON changes in user-friendly way, so that user can find it and understand the change of context, if the input is empty, just return what changes want, okay, so it will only run if there is a change, so we don't have to worry about anything, this one was failing, so there is a fallback model as well, so I'm not sure if it is because of the API keys or something, but this one is failing, API Gemini.  A bad request.

50:44 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Can you open the one?

50:47 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  This is empty input. You have not set up properly.

50:53 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yes. Okay, can you go back?

50:57 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Sure, sir. Let me see.

50:59 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Can you click on the. And where are you passing the JSON? Prompt.

51:16 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Like if, let's see if it is looking for OpenAI, no changes found. So if it is receiving the no changes found because there is no actual changes.  How do you check that, what is the input here? So it is empty right now. So if it is empty, then it's returning no changes found.  If it's working for JGPT, then it should work for...

51:44 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So what I would recommend is your prompt and your data is mixed. It should be in different places.

51:53 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  The prompt is here and the system message is here. Okay.

51:58 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Add some text to it. So before the... This one, no, no, in the prompt. So, add some text before the JSON starts.  And JSON, make it two texts.

52:24 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  And if you execute it, but let's see with this one, because it is empty. Can we still add two texts?  So, let's try with this JSON.changes.

52:45 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Again, it's still passing JSON.changes.

52:48 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay, this time it worked.

52:49 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah, because that entire field was empty. That's fine. you. Wow. Thank you.

53:01 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think give it a limit of 100 of less under 200 characters okay 2.5 less so I accept this here let me just see so by the time step I guess I could check to check is the correct response check I'm not sure if it is correct change it alone not in this form python import json so if you go to not yet oh what is this output for the provided input modified components it's not user friendly so it was generated by ZCPT let's check again give an example for the scene again  Let's try this one. For the scenario, automatic audit PDF modules, you get this one and this one.

54:08 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So I think what you should do is ask it to write in plain text and give it one or two examples of how it should write.

54:18 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think I will just update it. Could you please give me a detailed one so that I will use that.  OK.

54:26 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  OK. Yeah.

54:27 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Gemini model. Good. So using 2.5 layers, I think this will work for our use cases. Yeah. That's, I think, one more thing I did yesterday.  Yeah. Let's move on.

54:43 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  OK. Let's quickly identify. the items in green are the ones that we are currently tracking. So, you know, if this is missing anything.  So in AirPen, we have changes to regenerate. This year, what do you think the progress looks like?

55:07 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think 50%.

55:10 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  How much time?

55:13 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  20 minutes. It won't take enough time.

55:22 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Quality of your work?

55:25 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  7, 8 I think. It's failing right now. Yeah, the prompt is not. Challenges were not something that you can do anything you want.

55:42 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  3. It wasn't challenging for you. Learning and growth are also 3. wasn't very... 4, 5.

55:51 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  You have heard me with the like text input. have to input the text. Initiative, I would say 7. time.  Okay.

56:00 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Table Tracker. T. the Where are we on that? It was 40%.

56:07 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Right now, I think we are pretty good. I should say 60 or 55. Let's keep it 55. Okay. Let it run two, three days and let's see how it's performing right now.  Efforts. Let's keep it editable tracker only. So one hour, would say one and something like that. Divide all of them like four hours in all of the core automations.

56:37 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Just one hour across all four? Yeah.

56:41 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Because one of them took a lot of time, but other was not that.

56:45 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay. Okay. I'll just copy it over then. Let's say a few minutes. Yeah.

56:55 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Quality challenges of Tim. Eight. Mm-hmm. Hmm, seven or, yeah, seven, seven, challenges. Learning and growth, yeah, keep it six, seven.  At least I was able to find, like, okay, this is the issue, like, the first time we were not able to, and I was quickly able to find, okay, just one node here and there, and we can solve it.

57:21 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay.

57:22 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Initiative, hmm, I think 89. Okay.

57:29 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Uh, then we have, okay, let's go to trackers first. Um, fill out tracker. Hey, I would say essentially the same, right?  Yeah.

57:50 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Schematic.

57:51 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  I this is the, uh, this is completed, right? The, the actual infrastructure, not those are individual. Oh, yeah. Cool.  Yeah.

58:03 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think we have two or three fields, additional error fields. if it's 70 for now, we might need additional fields in the future.  How much time did spend on that, setting up the base?

58:16 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  I think remove it.

58:17 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  think no need to do it. Yeah, just two or three fields set it to what we need to do.  This is, we can say pretty much done, right?

58:26 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah, for now.

58:28 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  We need a small English as per our current requirement. Okay. I think, okay. We can add the mini IO integration in this one for now.

58:47 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  yeah.

58:48 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah. took me around two and half hours because I made an... Okay, then let's do other ratings also, is it the same as above?  Yeah, think challenges will be higher.

59:19 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay.

59:21 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah, quality will be seven, yeah, eight, I guess. Learning both eight as well.

59:31 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay.

59:34 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Initiative, nine. Okay.

59:40 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Then we have workflow mapping tool. Why did we mark it 50%? Yeah, we did.

59:51 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think it was for initial one. Yeah, that's fine.

59:57 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Where do you think we are at? In this one?

1:00:01 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Hmm. Cuando otras propone mía, It's It has been changed entirely.

1:00:07 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  What do you say? 35%. How much time have you spent in the last three weeks?

1:00:16 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  The last three weeks, I would say, till now, I've spent around 13-14 hours.

1:00:24 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  It's been 2-3 days, I guess.

1:00:26 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Quality will be 6-6. Challenges will be 10. Learning and growth will be 11.

1:00:39 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay.

1:00:41 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Initiative will be 5 or 4-5-4, something like that. Yeah.

1:00:48 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I mean, this is something new and challenging for you. Yeah. What did we miss? Okay. So we are not doing anything, we haven't done anything on documentation management and search this time, right?

1:01:01 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Yeah. Nothing on that. I think the next one is AirPen dashboard, and it's automation, I would say. There were lots of automation in that.

1:01:28 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  What have we done here? Just to list a few items.

1:01:34 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Dashboard page, ugly design, the N10 workflows, the API, the fetching of tools, the syncing of tools. These are all the things.  The menu on the layout and the backend of the tool section. think I was implemented, but right now we are using your task management.

1:01:55 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah. Okay. How would you...

1:02:01 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  The progress so far for the entire app we are using like we are considering the workflow as well yeah the workflow is what I still do so like we are still 25 25 around something like that mm-hmm how much time would you spend on this hmm I would say around 40 40 hours 40 45 hours okay okay how do you rate the quality of your work overall six and challenges will be eight learning and growth will be eight mm-hmm any city will be I think five

1:03:02 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay, so just to recap about how are you feeling about bubble at this time? What compared to when you started earlier?  Before this project started? Yeah, I'm much comfortable in bubble right now.

1:03:17 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  And I think, except the layout design, I think I can pretty much build the app properly. But yeah, there are some things that that we can do much better than what I am implementing right now.

1:03:33 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  But yeah, I'm getting the hang of it.

1:03:36 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I know where all the things are. Right.

1:03:39 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. What is missing? So we're not doing this right now. Edit tracker. Credential storage and status tracking.  Status tracking.

1:03:56 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  What is status?

1:03:58 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  So API keys, storing API keys and checking of data.

1:04:07 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I think it's being stored and the status is being chipped.

1:04:12 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Should we track it separately or is it part of the other trackers itself? I would say it's a part of other trackers.

1:04:22 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  But like Mac is different and that is different and it's different for Flow. So, I think this is a pretty much a holistic group, credential storage and status tracking so that we can, status tracking and I would say add new tools tracking as well in this one.

1:04:43 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  The new tools will add one of like as we are adding new tools, right? So automatically new tools. So like, so you're saying like this one.  Okay.

1:04:59 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  If you have got API key tracking so in this. here. In the we are checking for the tools as well.

1:05:19 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Where do you think we are?

1:05:24 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay, 30%.

  Yeah, large part of it is also, which we haven't covered yet, which is how do you secure your API keys?  Yeah, that is it. We don't have it secured right now. So yeah, if anybody gets access to the table instance, of course, they'll have everybody's keys.  So we would need to have a different solution sooner than later.

1:05:54 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  I was thinking for the encryption kind of, encryption and decryption using the same salt key.

1:06:01 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  But if you lose.

1:06:02 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  the salt key, then the whole API keys will be lost. So that is something. Yeah, mean, there's no service for it.

1:06:09 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  You can't use. Oh, you actually have services. Do you know that, right? Let's switch off. This is a secret manager.

1:06:46 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay, I will take a look on that as well. I don't know exactly what they're supposed to do, but they're probably supposed to secure.  I think we can take a look on that as well. Yeah.

1:07:01 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Seva. Okay, how much time do you spend on that?

1:07:12 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Status tracking, I think two hours or one hour, like if it's one hour.

1:07:20 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay. Quality will be six, like we were just tracking the takeaways.

1:07:26 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Challenges were not enough, so four. Learning and growth will be three, four. I mean, just using the error handling first time.  Initiative will be seven, eight.

1:07:44 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay. Yeah. Okay, we have that covered. Then we have .

1:07:54 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)

1:08:02 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Thank Audit Tracker, PDFs, we are not doing that right? No. Nothing in here. Asana told me nothing.

1:09:16 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Where is this project? I lost it.

1:09:20 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)

1:09:28 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Okay.

  How do you feel about the last two, three weeks of work?

1:09:54 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  It's good. I am becoming better at solving the issues.

1:09:58 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Planning at least.

1:10:00 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  That is much better than what I was used to. And yeah, we have made a lot of progress in the project, the UI, all of this.  I think your vision is coming into SAFE. And in the future, I think we are going to have a very good time using this tool.

1:10:21 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Okay, let's start. Once you set up, let's see how it turns out.

1:10:27 - Rahul Gupta (Vikas Vimal)
  Right now, in my mind, there is only one thing, that we are commenting someone's name in the tools and mentioning someone, okay, why didn't you do that?  Why, how you do that? This is what right now is in my, not the StoryMapper and other things.

1:10:42 - Vikas Vimal (vikas.vimal90@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I think I will check how commenting works. think there is a plugin I put in there, but I have not configured it yet.  So let's... Okay, that's it. Do you have any questions for me?
