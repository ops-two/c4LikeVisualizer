# Visual Workflow Architect - Technical Implementation Plan

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Project Setup
- [ ] Create new repository for Visual Workflow Architect plugin
- [ ] Set up development environment with React Flow dependencies
- [ ] Configure jsDelivr CDN deployment pipeline
- [ ] Create Bubble test app with required data types

#### 1.2 Data Layer Implementation
- [ ] **data-store.js**: Centralized state management
  - Implement `init()` for Bubble data loading
  - Create entity management functions (`getFeature()`, `getContainers()`, `getSequences()`, `getWorkflows()`)
  - Add update/create/delete operations with validation
  - Handle data transformation between Bubble format and internal objects

- [ ] **event-bridge.js**: Bubble communication layer
  - Port successful patterns from storymap-grid
  - Implement event handlers: `container_updated`, `sequence_updated`, `workflow_updated`
  - Add custom state management for `pending_update` JSON payloads
  - Create debounced update system (300ms) to prevent race conditions

#### 1.3 Basic Plugin Structure
- [ ] Create plugin entry point following Bubble plugin requirements
- [ ] Implement async data loading with error handling
- [ ] Set up modular file structure with CDN loading
- [ ] Add basic error boundaries and fallback UI

- [ ] User presence indicators
- [ ] Comment system for sequences and workflows

### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization (Week 9-10)

#### 5.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Viewport culling for large diagrams
- [ ] Virtualization for >100 sequences
- [ ] Memory management and cleanup
- [ ] Bundle size optimization

#### 5.2 Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Orphaned sequence cleanup when containers deleted
- [ ] Circular dependency prevention
- [ ] Data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing

#### 5.3 Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Plugin documentation for Bubble marketplace
- [ ] User guide with examples
- [ ] Unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Integration tests with Bubble workflows

## Technical Architecture Details

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Bubble Database → data-store.js → view-manager.js → React Flow Components
                                      ↓
User Interactions → event-bridge.js → Bubble Workflows → Database Updates
```

### React Flow Configuration
```javascript
const nodeTypes = {
  container: ContainerNode,
  workflowGroup: WorkflowGroupNode
};

const edgeTypes = {
  sequence: SequenceEdge,
  selfSequence: SelfSequenceEdge
};

const reactFlowProps = {
  nodeTypes,
  edgeTypes,
  fitView: true,
  attributionPosition: 'bottom-left',
  minZoom: 0.1,
  maxZoom: 2,
  defaultViewport: { x: 0, y: 0, zoom: 1 }
};
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **React Flow Performance**: Large diagrams may cause performance issues
   - *Mitigation*: Implement viewport culling and virtualization
   - *Fallback*: Pagination for large workflows

2. **Bubble Plugin Constraints**: Fixed dimensions and async loading
   - *Mitigation*: Follow proven storymap-grid patterns
   - *Fallback*: Graceful degradation to static view

3. **Real-time Collaboration**: Concurrent edits may cause conflicts
   - *Mitigation*: Implement conflict resolution with user notifications
   - *Fallback*: Last-write-wins with manual refresh option

### User Experience Risks
1. **Learning Curve**: Complex interface may confuse users
   - *Mitigation*: Progressive disclosure, tooltips, and guided tutorials
   - *Fallback*: Simplified mode with basic features only

2. **Data Loss**: Unsaved changes lost on plugin re-render
   - *Mitigation*: Auto-save with debouncing, local storage backup
   - *Fallback*: Clear warnings before destructive actions

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Plugin loads successfully in <3 seconds
- Supports up to 20 containers and 100 sequences without performance degradation
- 99% uptime for CDN-hosted assets
- Zero data corruption incidents

### User Experience Metrics
- Users can create a complete workflow diagram in <10 minutes
- 90% of users successfully navigate between all three views
- <5% error rate for common operations (add/edit/delete)
- Positive feedback on visual clarity and ease of use

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
1. Local development with hot reload
2. Bubble test app for integration testing
3. Staging environment with production data simulation

### Production Deployment
1. GitHub repository with automated testing
2. jsDelivr CDN for reliable asset delivery
3. Versioned releases with rollback capability
4. Bubble Plugin Marketplace submission

### Monitoring & Maintenance
1. Error tracking and performance monitoring
2. User feedback collection and analysis
3. Regular updates for React Flow and dependencies
4. Documentation updates and user support

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the Visual Workflow Architect plugin while leveraging proven patterns from the existing storymap-grid implementation and addressing the specific requirements identified in the meeting transcripts.
